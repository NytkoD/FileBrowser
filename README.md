This is a barebones Automation Studio demo for a FileBrowsing library and compound widget to provide users with an easy to setup and use interface.
This interface will allow a user to browse multiple devices, filter, click to select or scroll using buttons, then output the selected filepath.

The library and compound widget can be copied out of this project in any other project using mappview.

Keep in mind the library has dependencies.

Once copied into a separate project, new bindings will need to be made and function block inputs will need to be changed to match the new projects variables.

I recommend having the filebrowser widget on a dialog content.
Device names will need to be passed into the library.
